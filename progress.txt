## Session - 2026-02-26

**Completed:**
- Built full 4-page Astro + Tailwind site for Suite Manager LLC
- Competitor research: 7 hotel management company sites analyzed
- Design direction: DM Serif Display + Inter, navy (#1A1A2E) + gold (#B8955A) + cream (#F8F6F1)
- Pages: Home, Services, About, Contact
- Components: Nav (transparent→solid scroll), Footer, HeroCTA
- Hero: video background (hero.mp4, extended stay property, daytime), centered layout
- Logo.png placed above hero headline (h-40 mobile / h-56 desktop, inverted white)
- Trust bar: 4 icon cards (building, shield, home, chart icons)
- Copy: benefits-focused, no litotes, company voice (not personal)
- Created GitHub repo: github.com/realjbmangum/site-suitemanagerllc
- Deployed to Cloudflare Pages, connected suitemanagerllc.com

**Key Fix:**
- global.css was never imported in BaseLayout.astro — nothing was styled until this was caught
- btn-primary/btn-ghost rewritten as vanilla CSS (no @apply) to guarantee rendering

**Files:**
- src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro — imports global.css (critical fix)
- src/styles/global.css — all button styles, animations, utilities
- src/pages/index.astro — hero with logo + video bg, trust bar, services, how-we-work, CTA
- src/pages/services.astro — 6 service sections alternating layout
- src/pages/about.astro — principles, story, values
- src/pages/contact.astro — 3 contact options + Web3Forms form
- src/components/Nav.astro — text wordmark, transparent→solid, gold progress bar
- src/components/Footer.astro — logo image (inverted white), nav links, contact
- src/components/HeroCTA.astro — reusable dark CTA section
- public/logo.png — logo image
- public/hero.mp4 — hero background video

**Placeholders Chris Still Needs to Fill:**
- [ ] Real phone number (currently (555) 000-0000)
- [ ] Real email (currently hello@suitemanagerllc.com)
- [ ] Web3Forms access key (contact form won't submit without it)
- [ ] Calendly link for "Schedule a Call" button on contact page
- [ ] Real bio/background for About page Our Story section
- [ ] City, State for footer location blurb
- [ ] Headshot photo (placeholder shows "CM" initials)

**Decisions:**
- Nav uses CSS filter (brightness invert) to flip logo white on dark hero — no separate white logo needed
- btn-primary = gold bg (#B8955A) + white text — rendered as vanilla CSS not @apply
- Hero content padding zeroed out — section min-h-[90vh] handles vertical centering
- No body padding-top — hero sections use internal padding to clear fixed nav

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Chris to fill in all placeholder content above
- [ ] Set up Web3Forms account and add access key
- [ ] Add Calendly link
- [ ] Consider adding a testimonials section once Chris has client quotes
- [ ] Google Analytics / Cloudflare Analytics setup
